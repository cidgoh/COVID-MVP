D1118H	S	T cell evasion	 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/29/science.abh1282	 Reynolds et al. (2021) 		 Mutation is predicted to lose the T cell epitope for people carrying DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401,  but not for example in those who are DRB1*0701 or DRB1*1501 who would be predicted to show an enhanced response. This is also observed in a study of 26 each post-infection and post first dose HCWs.
E484K	S	T cell evasion	 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/29/science.abh1282	 Reynolds et al. (2021) 		 Analyzing responses to the E484K mutation seen in B.1.351 and P.1 variants, we noted that it did  not fall in a region predicted to bind the HLAII alleles tested (table S4). The mutation appeared  to have no substantial or differential impact on T cell responses.
N501Y	S	T cell evasion	 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/29/science.abh1282	 Reynolds et al. (2021) 		 Vaccinated, but not post-infection sera, show decreased average T cell response to an N501Y peptide. When we primed transgenic mice expressing human HLA-DRB1*0401 with the Wuhan Hu-1 peptide pool,  T cell responses to the B.1.1.7 variant peptide pool were significantly reduced (p = 0.0286).  Furthermore, the T cell response to the spike N501Y mutation common to all three of the current VOC was ablated.

(2021) 	'T20N', 'P26S', 'D138Y', 'R190S'	 The neutralization titer of NTD-binding mAb159 was 133-fold reduced on P.1 compared to Victoria (~wild type), with only 64% neutralization at 10 μg/mL.  Residues 20, 18, and 138 form a cluster underlying the 245–259 loop, which inserts into a groove between the light and heavy chains of Fab 159. In addition, the N-terminal residues preceding residue 18 interact with the antibody and may be perturbed.  Given that there is likely a single supersite ("i") for potent NTD-binding antibodies, the binding of many of these are likely affected. Using 20 potent (primaruly anti-RBD) antibodies, neutralization was measured by a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and compared with  neutralization of Victoria (~wild type) and variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Compared to Victoria neutralization by the mAbs was significantly impacted by P.1,  with 12/20 showing > 10-fold reduction in FRNT50 titer and a number showing complete knockout of activity. The results with P.1 showed a  greater impact compared to B.1.1.7 but were, as expected, similar to those with B.1.351.

Predicted to shift the signal peptide cleavage site from S13-Q14 to C15-V16, which can affect NTD conformation.  PG: in saying S12F does not shift the signal peptide nor affect mAb binding, this manuscript appears to contradict the  text of McCallum et al.'s earlier 2021 manuscript stating that S12F *does* affected some mAb binding via putative signal peptide shift.

These results suggest that the individual N501Y mutation does not contribute to altered viral properties by itself, but may contribute to a collective conformational shift produced by multiple mutations.

Another important energetic contribution comes from the altered orientation of Tyr41 which is now involved with  two hydrogen-bonding interactions with Asp355 and Thr500.

D614G	S	trafficking	 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19808-4	 Zhang et l. (2020) 		 We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than wild type (~9-fold).  This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion.  D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may  increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.

Sera from 13 subjects post-B.1.1.7 infection showed no significant change in neutralization against Victoria (~wild type), suggesting that B.1.1.7 infection also protects against ancestral virus.

Subject G 18 days post-infection showed ~7 fold reduction in neutralization, but no immune escape at day 94. Notably, Subject G had no E484K/Q effect at either the early or late timepoints.
E484Q	S	convalescent plasma escape	 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.02.003	 Greaney et al. (2021) 		 In 3 of 11 subjects' convalescent sera in an early+late mutational landscape analysis of the RBD,  E484Q shows a notably resistant profile, comparable to or even more resistant than E484K at  later time points (i.e. more resistant to immune cell somatic mutation evolution), see Figure 5a,b. Subject C 32 days post-infection showed >>10 fold reduction in neutralization, reducing to ~10-fold by day 104. Subject B 26 days post-infection showed ~10 fold reduction in neutralization, reducing to ~4x at day 113. Notably, Subject B also showed smaller than typical (~10 vs 30+ fold) reduction in one-month neutralization by E484K at day 32,  and no E484K immune escape at day 104. Subject I 26 days post-infection showed ~10 fold reduction in neutralization, with no reduction in escape at day 102. Notably, Subject I also showed smaller than typical (~10 vs 30+ fold) reduction in one-month neutralization by E484K at day 26,  and no E484K immune escape at day 102.
S494P	S	convalescent plasma escape	 http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.22.441007	 Alenquer et al. (2021) 		 S494P frequently engages in interactions with antibodies but not with ACE2. It reduces antibody  neutralization of all 16 convalescent sera tested, averaging WT ratio of 0.41+-0.08 (less dramatic than E484K).  This amino acid emerges as an additional hotspot for immune evasion and a target for therapies, vaccines and diagnostics. It has emerged independently in multiple lineages.

Assuming instead that 501Y.V2 is identically transmissible, the new variant evades 21% (95% CrI: 11-36%) of previously acquired immunity. Reality may lie between these extremes, with an intermediate increase in transmissibility and mildly imperfect cross-protection from past exposure.

Compared to January to March 2021, B.1.351 variant had a significant  transmission advantage over B.1.1.7 in some regions (15.1 to 16.1% in Île-de-France and 16.1 to 18.8% in Hauts-de-France). This shift in transmission advantage is consistent with the immune evasion abilities of B.1.351 and the high levels of immunization in these regions.

(2021) 	'K417N', 'N501Y', 'D614G'	 Assuming complete cross-protection, we estimate 501Y.V2/B.1.351 was 1.50 (95% CrI: 1.20-2.13) times as transmissible than previously circulating variants. Assuming instead that 501Y.V2 is identically transmissible, the new variant evades 21% (95% CrI: 11-36%) of previously acquired immunity. Reality may lie between these extremes, with an intermediate increase in transmissibility and mildly imperfect cross-protection from past exposure.

Not surprisingly, viruses can modulate SG formation in infected cells through interactions with SG effector proteins. Methylation of N protein at R95 causes the suppression of SG formation through host-protein interactions.

(2021) 	'D80A', 'L242del', 'R246I', 'K417N', 'E484K', 'N501Y', 'A701V'	 During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 in a nursing home, all non-vaccinated residents (5/5) versus  half of those fully vaccinated 2-5 weeks prior with BNT162b2 (13/26) were infected. Two of 13 vaccinated versus 4 of 5  non-vaccinated residents presented severe disease. BNT162b2 did not prevent the outbreak, but reduced  transmission and disease severity. Among the 13 fully vaccinated residents who were infected, 2 (15.4%) presented with an asymptomatic disease, 9 (69.2%) developed mild to moderate symptoms, and 2 (15.4%) progressed to severe disease with fatal evolution secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There was no relationship between anti-S antibody levels at diagnosis and disease severity. Overall, the proportion of residents with severe disease in the non-vaccinated group (4/5)  was higher than that in the vaccinated group (2/13). Only 1 vaccinated staff, but 10 unvaccinated were infected in the outbreak (no severe disease).

Those who were vaccinated and went on to have symptoms had a 44%  lower risk of being admitted hospital and a 51% lower risk of death compared with people who were unvaccinated. We also found that a single dose  of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was about 60-75% effective against symptomatic disease and provided an additional protective effect against hospital  admission—it is too early to assess the effect on mortality. The B.1.1.7 variant now dominates in the UK and these results will largely  reflect vaccine effectiveness against this variant.

Adjusted rate reduction in SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity infection compared with unvaccinated workers 1-14 days  after 1st dose was 30% (95% CI: 2-50), and 75% (95% CI: 72-84) after 15-28 days. Adjusted rate reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 compared with  unvaccinated workers 1-14 days after 1st dose was 47% (95% CI: 17-66), and 85% (95% CI: 71-92) after 15-28 days. [Though often cited as an indicator of VE for B.1.1.7, during this time period in Israel, the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant increased from ~20% to 50% of  cases (covariants.org), therefore these VE numbers likely represent a mix of B.1.1.7 and other lineage effects.]

Those who were vaccinated and went on to have symptoms had a 44%  lower risk of being admitted hospital and a 51% lower risk of death compared with people who were unvaccinated. We also found that a single dose  of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was about 60-75% effective against symptomatic disease and provided an additional protective effect against hospital  admission—it is too early to assess the effect on mortality. The B.1.1.7 variant now dominates in the UK and these results will largely  reflect vaccine effectiveness against this variant.

This cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B.1.1.7 and demonstrates effectiveness against this variant.

Adjusted rate reduction in SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity infection compared with unvaccinated workers 1-14 days  after 1st dose was 30% (95% CI: 2-50), and 75% (95% CI: 72-84) after 15-28 days. Adjusted rate reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 compared with  unvaccinated workers 1-14 days after 1st dose was 47% (95% CI: 17-66), and 85% (95% CI: 71-92) after 15-28 days. [Though often cited as an indicator of VE for B.1.1.7, during this time period in Israel, the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant increased from ~20% to 50% of  cases (covariants.org), therefore these VE numbers likely represent a mix of B.1.1.7 and other lineage effects.]

Those who were vaccinated and went on to have symptoms had a 44%  lower risk of being admitted hospital and a 51% lower risk of death compared with people who were unvaccinated. We also found that a single dose  of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was about 60-75% effective against symptomatic disease and provided an additional protective effect against hospital  admission—it is too early to assess the effect on mortality. The B.1.1.7 variant now dominates in the UK and these results will largely  reflect vaccine effectiveness against this variant.

The two physicians  were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine, with the second dose administered 1 month before symptom onset. Both had high titres of IgG  anti-spike antibodies at the time of diagnosis. WGS confirmed that all virus strains were VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7, suggesting a  common source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the suspected source was a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who  required endotracheal intubation due to severe COVID-19. All procedures were carried out using a full suite of personal protective equipment (PPE).

(2021) 	'A570D'	 Partial sequencing of S gene reveals two cases of probable early 2021 B.1.1.7 lineage reinfection from non-B.1.1.7 original cases in Lombardy, with 45 to 90 days between infections (less than the typical 90 day guideline for this call). Patients were 56 and 58yo, immunocompenent, with one a former smoker with obesity and dyslipidemia. One case required intubation during first infection,  but presented with mild symptoms upon reinfection. The other case convalesced at home during the first episode, but required CPAP support  in the subacute clinical unit upon reinfection.
