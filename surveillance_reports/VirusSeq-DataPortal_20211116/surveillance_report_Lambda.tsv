This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion.  D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may  increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.
