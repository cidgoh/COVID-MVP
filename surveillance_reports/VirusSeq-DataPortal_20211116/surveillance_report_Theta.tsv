(2021)		While the introduction of P681H in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant may increase spike cleavage by furin-like proteases,  this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread. We consider that other factors are at play to account  for the increased in transmission and disease severity attributed to this variant of concern (VOC).	False	True	Theta	inactive			06-Jul-2021

In a homologuous site in Infectious  Bronchitis Virus (IBV, Gammacoronaviruses), abolition of S680 phosphorylation improves furin cleavage  (and presumably cell entry).

(2021)		Lentiviral pseudotyped with this individual mutation from B.1.1.7 was tested on ACE2.293T cells. Luciferase activity was measured two days postinfection,  showing NO statistically significant infection rate change amongst the cells, suggesting that furin cleavage typically used for cell entry is not affected by this change one  amino acid upstream of the RXXR recognition pattern.
