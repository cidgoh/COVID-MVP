This was an average of a 2-fold increase, relative to sera drawn from the  individuals who received one dose of vaccination—mean NT50 dilution of 51,300. Importantly, a 6-fold increase in mean NT50 dilution was  obtained when sera from the first vaccination dose was compared to convalescent sera from cohort with severe disease (NT50 51,000 vs 8,700)  21 to 63 days post-onset.

A single asymptomatic patient, who had no detectable RBD-specific IgG memory before vaccination, also did not elicit nAbs against the B.1.351 variant. [compare to ~10 fold with L242del] ID50 titres in non-infected mRNA vaccines more than two weeks post-booster were signficiant, but >100x weaker than in previously infected  patients after first dose.

Neutralization by 3 Moderna vaccine sera 28 days post-booster was 3-fold resistant (vs. 2.2-fold for B.1.351). The resistance of B.1.618 was caused by the E484K mutation, based on results from viruses pseudotyped for individual variants within B.1.618.	False	B.1.351	B.1.351=True	de_escalated		18-Dec-2020
